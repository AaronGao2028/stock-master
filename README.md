# Stock Master

You may have heard the statistic "over 90% of retail investors lose money in the stock market". But what should be more shocking is that "Over the past decade, an annual average of only 27.1% of actively managed funds benchmarked to the S&P 500 beat it" (The Wall Street Journal, 2024). While it is quite likely that a person who steps onto the trading floor after hearing about "a hot tip" from a friend will lose their investment, it is something else for only a quarter of trained finance professionals to beat their benchmarks.

Stock Master offers retail investors an opportunity to build customized portfolios based on their risk tolerance, investment objectives, and market exposure preferences. Using the Efficient Frontier, the input preferences will be queried against a financial dataset of over 6000 publicly traded securities and optimized to build a basket of stocks with the highest returns for the lowest risk. Each portfolio is custom generated to user specifications and analyzes historical patterns to determine optimal entry and exit points.
